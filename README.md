Rebooting the `std::bitset` franchise
-------------------------------------

An `int_set<N>` is a modern reimagining of `std::bitset<N>`, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. `int_set`s are array-backed sets of integers that are compact and fast: they do less (i.e. they don't do bounds-checking, and they don't throw exceptions) and offer more (e.g. iterators to seamlessly interact with the rest of the Standard Library). This enables you to do your bit-twiddling with familiar syntax, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.

Requirements
------------

These header-only libraries are continuously being tested with the following conforming [C++17](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4659.pdf) compilers:
